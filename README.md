# Case Study on Tala

## Tala is a digital lending startup that was founded by Shivani Siroya in 2011. After having several jobs throughout the finance industry, Siroya came across a statistic that really stood out to her. It was that only about 30% of the adult population is covered by a credit bureau. They are not even seen and the world could be missing out on huge innovative ideas. Tala raised $65 million from Revolution Capital, Lowercase Capital, and Female Fouders Fund, among others and have raised over $110 million to date.

## Siroya states that there are 3 billion adults around the globe who do not have access to basic financial services, like the ability to borrow, save, or grow their money. These adults deserve the opportunity to be able to take out small loans for whatever life may throw at them. One man from Kenya used the app to help pay his son's student loan bills, while someone else got a small loan to help start their business. The company's intended customer is obviously those who are unable to secure a loan by traditional methods or who do not have a credit score at all. Tala utilizes the fact that most banks or lending services do not want to lend to someone who does not have a credit score. Tala has created their own system by which they measure a person's credit score. Tala looks at a customer's texts and call logs, merchant transactions, overall app usage and other behavioral data through its Android powered app to build their credit profile. They also use machine learning technology from a user's smartphone to predict a user's capacity to borrow and the user's associated repayment/default patterns.
