## Tala is a digital lending startup that was founded by Shivani Siroya in 2011. After having several jobs throughout the finance industry, Siroya came across a statistic that really stood out to her. It was that only about 30% of the adult population is covered by a credit bureau. They are not even seen and the world could be missing out on huge innovative ideas. Tala raised $65 million from Revolution Capital, Lowercase Capital, and Female Fouders Fund, among others and have raised over $110 million to date.

## Siroya states that there are 3 billion adults around the globe who do not have access to basic financial services, like the ability to borrow, save, or grow their money. These adults deserve the opportunity to be able to take out small loans for whatever life may throw at them. One man from Kenya used the app to help pay his son's student loan bills, while someone else got a small loan to help start their business. The company's intended customer is obviously those who are unable to secure a loan by traditional methods or who do not have a credit score at all. Tala utilizes the fact that most banks or lending services do not want to lend to someone who does not have a credit score. Tala has created their own system by which they measure a person's credit score. Tala looks at a customer's texts and call logs, merchant transactions, overall app usage and other behavioral data through its Android powered app to build their credit profile. They also use machine learning technology from a user's smartphone to predict a user's capacity to borrow and the user's associated repayment/default patterns.

## Tala is in the lending industry and is one of the few company's that will try to work with customer's who do not have a traditinal means to prove credit worthyness. Some of the biggest innovations in lending over the past decade have been: peer to peer lending, alterntative credit scoring, small ticket loans, digital banking, and asset management. All of these are designed to make lending as easy as possible for every borrower. Some of the major companies in this type of lending are: Aire, ZestFinance, Kreditech, and Wecash.

## Tala has impacted individuals all over the globe who have not been able to get a loan because of their status. This has led to new ideas, businesses, and innovations in parts of the world that normally would not not have been possible. One of the most important metrics in a lending company is the payback rate. More than 90% of Tala users pay back their loan in 20 to 30 days and are recurring customers, compared to just 83.5% in US subprime loans. This also helps improve their credit history more and thus the ability to secure bigger loans.

## I would advise them to keep track of how a user is doing in terms of their credit score and business metrics. They could then use this data to see if other companies would be interested in financing them and their innovation. This would give borrowers more drive to ensure that they are successful in their business venture because it could lead to further funding and expanstion down the road. This would utilize machine learning and basic data analytics to pick out individuals who are doing the best in a particular region in terms of credit score.
